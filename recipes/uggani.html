            <li>Finely chop onions, green chilies, and coriander leaves.</li>
            <li>Break dry red chilies into pieces.</li>
            <li>Heat 2-3 tablespoons of oil in a large pan or kadhai.</li>
            <li>Add 1 teaspoon of mustard seeds and 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds to the hot oil.</li>
            <li>Once the seeds start to splutter, add 2-3 broken dry red chilies and 8-10 curry leaves. Sauté for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>Add finely chopped green chilies and 1 large finely chopped onion to the pan.</li>
            <li>Sauté until the onions turn translucent.</li>

            <li>Add 4 cups of puffed rice (murmura) to the pan. Mix gently to coat the puffed rice evenly with the onion-spice mixture</li>
