    <h3>steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse 2 cups of poha (flattened rice) in a colander under running water for a few seconds. Drain and set aside. Be gentle to avoid breaking the poha.</li>
        <li>Finely chop onions, green chilies, and fresh cilantro leaves.</li>
        <li>Boil and dice potatoes if using.</li>
        <li>Heat 2-3 tablespoons of oil in a pan or kadhai over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add 1 teaspoon of mustard seeds and 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds to the hot oil.</li>
        <li>Once the seeds start to splutter, add 2-3 finely chopped green chilies and 8-10 curry leaves. Sauté for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Add 1 medium-sized finely chopped onion to the pan. Sauté until translucent.</li>
        <li>If using boiled potatoes, add them to the pan and sauté for another minute.</li>
        <li>Add the rinsed and drained poha to the pan.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder, salt to taste, and optionally, 1/2 teaspoon of sugar over the poha. Gently mix to combine.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan and let the poha cook for 3-4 minutes on low heat. This allows the flavors to blend and the poha to become soft.</li>
        <li>Once the poha is cooked, squeeze 1-2 tablespoons of lemon juice over it.</li>
        <li>Garnish with roasted peanuts, fresh chopped cilantro leaves, and grated coconut if desired.</li>
